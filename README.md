# DbSpace is an untility which helps to get information about databases and their used space.
It's a sample of MVVM application. I used light MVVM library MvvmLight (https://mvvmlight.codeplex.com). It already has implementation of base viewmodel (ViewModelBase) and commands (RelayCommand). More about this library you can read here https://mvvmlight.codeplex.com. For showing the results in table representation I used XCeedGrid (wpftoolkit.codeplex.com/) instead of standard WPF DataGrid, because it's more powerfull.
